# PowerBi-Data-Analysis-Dashboard-ATLIQ-HR-DATA-ANALYTICS-DASHBOARD
In this end-to-end data analytics project, I took a REAL dataset for employee presence from a company called AtliQ and perform data analysis in Power BI. The HR from AtliQ Technologies conveyed her requirements and I built a Power BI dashboard for her to help her with employee insights. 

OBJECTIVE : HR of ATLIQ wants me to help them create a dashboard to track and analyze their employee presence insights.


## QUESTIONS (KPIs)
- compare the presence % by date
- compare the WFH % by date
- compare the Sick Leave % by date 
- make a list of all the employees showing their percentage of office presence, WFH, SL
- make a list of all days of the week showing percentage of office presence, WFH, SL

## Process 

verify data for any missing values and anomalies, and sort out the same. 

made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.

## POWER BI :
- DATA CLEANING(REMOVING DUPLICATES, MODIFYING) AND SORTING IN eXCEL DATA SHEET


## Project Conclusion 

created interactive dashboard to track and analyze employee presence, and other data relevant to the operation of the oragnisation. 

used complex parameters to drill down in worksheet and customization using filters and slicers. 

created connections, join new tables, calculations to manipulate data and enable user driven parameters for visualizations 

used different types of customized visualization.
